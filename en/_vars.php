$tradAProposText = 'The <i>Manifesto for Sustainable Practices in Creative Activities</i> was cowritten by Vonnik Hertig, Roxane Jubert and Annabel Vergne in 2019 at ENSAD (Paris, France), and was finalized by a group which included Clément Assoun, Margot Bonnafous, Michèle Ducret, Marion Leclercq, Clémence Leveugle, Coralie Nadaud, Martine Nicot and Christophe Thomas. It was the fruit of diverse initiatives and enriched by numerous exchanges within a collective. It was supported by a group bringing together students, administrative staff, workshop coaches and teachers – all members of ENSAD. It aims to foster transversal fresh thinking – as a basis for a shared and participative commitment to deal with worldwide imbalances, and ecological, social and health challenges.
This manifesto was circulated at ENSAD at the end of 2019, when 160 members signed up to it – across all sections of the school.
We aim to share this text with everyone who identifies with it and wishes to sign up. We will gradually add other languages on this website, launched in June 2021.';

The graphics and the colours of the website are based on choices made for the <a href="/en/apropos.php">initial presentation of the manifesto, in silkscreen printing at the end of 2019 on large wooden planks</a>, made solely out of reused materials (wood panels found in the school garage and leftover ink from silkscreen prints, with what was a very limited choice of colours at the start of the school year 2019).
Website developer: Daniel Djordjevic, 2021.';

// MANIFESTE
$tradManifP1 = 'Faced with today’s highly critical environmental and ecological challenges, all of us involved in creative activities have decided to implement a major movement of transition and reconfiguration. The urgency of the current situation requires us to enforce our capacity to assess, rethink, express and reinvent.';

$tradManifP2 = 'Over and above raising awareness, we consider it imperative to seek solutions and act accordingly – to put creative projects, design and art at the very heart of our challenges – both today and tomorrow. Our overriding concern is with the preservation of the environment, which requires the sustainability and renewal of our habitual practices as well as our lifestyles. Design and art have a vital role to play in contributing to this growing awareness, and in allowing us to find the right balance to meet the basic needs of the environment and of living things in a sustainable way.';

$tradManifP3 = 'For these reasons, we are committed to adopting actively new professional, individual, collective and behavioural practices. Beyond that, we will need to conceive, plan and implement new operating methods – civic, cooperative, environmental, ecological, economic, etc.';


$tradManifListHeader1 = 'Our goal is to foster: ';

$tradManifList1 = '<li>– the emergence of a sustainable and resilient world</li>
<li>– the adoption of ethical values that protect life, the environment and the ecosphere</li>
<li>– the rational use of resources</li>
<li>– the consideration of the entire life cycle of products
    <br>and to reduce the environmental impact of our choices, our actions and our productions.
</li>';

$tradManifP4 = 'To this end, we need to redefine our priorities, develop the necessary expertise, question our practices, work with frugality in mind, identify and distinguish fundamental needs, opt for solutions that preserve environmental health and life, and eliminate all forms of waste.<br>These objectives require ecological awareness and action, integrating a holistic, interdependent vision of the world.';

$tradManifListHeader2 = 'We would like to emphasize the responsibility of all creatives in this major social and environmental undertaking in: ';

$tradManifList2 = ' <li>– taking responsibility for our work and the process through which it materializes, in all its dimensions and implications</li>
<li>– for each project, evaluating the reason for the commission, work, product or service in light of sustainable objectives</li>
<li>– considering the economy of materials and energy as integral and an added value to each project – a vital reflection of our concern for the state of the world and our commitment to nature</li>
<li>– promoting frugal practices</li>
<li>– helping to alleviate harm to our ecosystems</li>
<li>– opting for sustainable choices and favouring reuse to limit the production of new objects</li>
<li>– prioritizing simple, repairable, recyclable and biodegradable methods and products.
</li>';

$tradManifP5 = 'In our role both as creatives and citizens, we shall work in the interests of all and sundry. We need to grasp the current global challenge and harness our imagination and creativity in line with our ethical convictions. To this end, we must act with determination and aim for a transformation that is both clear-sighted and stimulating.';
